# LCxLC-IMS-HRMS
A browser application for the analysis of three-dimensional comprehensive LCxLC-IMS coupled to HRMS  

This plotly dash browser application visualizes LCxLC-IMS-HR in a three-dimensional in an interactice scatterplot. Data points in the scatter plot represent either a sum of all ions (TIC), single ions or the sum of extracted ions. Moreover, by clicking on a data point in the three-dimensional chromatogram the high resolution mass spectrum is displayed.  

Example data files are very large (> 400 MB) and can be provided on demand.

The data is based on Venter et al. Comprehensive Three-Dimensional LC × LC × Ion Mobility Spectrometry Separation Combined with High-Resolution MS for the Analysis of Complex Samples, Anal. Chem. 2018, 90, 19, 11643–11650 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b03234
